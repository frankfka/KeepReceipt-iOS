# KeepReceipt - iOS

KeepReceipt is a simple expense and receipt tracking app. A demo video can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08w6IOCBr0c)

Having always tracked my personal finances, I had large folders of past receipts. I envisioned a service that would allow for quick & simple digitization of non-critical receipts (i.e. receipts that didnâ€™t need to be in hard-copy form), so I decided to build KeepReceipt. 

Having built Betterplate, I had a fair grasp of basic iOS and Android programming concepts. KeepReceipt allowed me to gain further expertise and experience in mobile development, but I also wanted to challenge myself. After building an MVP of the app, I decided to introduce a sync feature - users would login via Google and enable sync of transaction details on Firebase Firestore.
